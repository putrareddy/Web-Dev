			<h3>Which Is a Strategy for Security?</h3>
			<p>A safety plan is a customized, realistic plan that provides ways to stay healthy while you are in a relationship, planning to leave, or going home. Security preparation covers how to deal with feelings, reveal the violence to friends and relatives, take legal action and more.</p>
			<p>At The Hotline we coordinate protection for victims, friends , and family members — whoever is worried about their own safety or someone else 's safety.</p>
			<p>A successful safety plan will provide all the essential details you need and will be customized to your particular situation, which will help you walk through different scenarios.</p>
			<p>And though some of the points you describe in your safety plan that seem obvious, it's important to note that your brain doesn't function the same way in times of crisis as when you're relaxed. It can be hard to think clearly when adrenaline is flowing through your bloodstream or make rational decisions about your health. During those tense times, getting a safety plan set out beforehand will help you protect yourself.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h3>Types of Safety Planning</h3>
			<div>
			<a type="button" class="btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#safety1">Safety While Living With An Abusive Partner</a>
			<div class="collapse"  id="safety1">
				<ul>
					<li>Identify the use and force level of your partner so you can determine the risk of physical threat to you and your kids before it happens.</li>
					<li>Identify safe house areas where there are no guns, and ways to escape. Consider going to those places if disputes occur.</li>
					<li>Don't run to where the kids are, as your partner might hurt them too.</li>
					<li>Make yourself a small target when violence is inevitable. Take a dive into a corner and curl up into a ball with your face covered and arms wrapped around either side of your head.</li>
					<li>Provide a cell available at all times if possible, and know what numbers to dial for assistance. Know where the closest public telephone is. Know The nearest shelter's phone number. When your life is at risk call the police.</li>
					<li>Make your condition known to trusted friends and neighbors and create a plan and visual signal when you need help.</li>
					<li>Teach your kids how to get some support. Tell them not to get involved in the abuse between your partner and you. Prepare a code word to tell them to get help, or leave the building.</li>
					<li>Tell your kids that violence never gets right, even though someone they love is being violent. Tell them that neither you nor they are to blame or are the cause of the abuse, and that it is vital to remain safe while someone is being aggressive.</li>
					<li>Plan what you'll do if your kids tell your plan partner, or your partner finds out about your plan otherwise.</li>
					<li>Make a habit of steering the car into the driveway and keeping it fuelled. Leave the driver's door open, and lock others — for a fast escape.</li>
					<li>Seek not to wear scarves or long jewellery that could strangle you.</li>
					<li>Having several valid excuses to leave the house at various times of day or night.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		    </div>
		    <div>
			<a type="button" class="btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#safety2">Safety Planning With Children</a>
			<div class="collapse" id="safety2">
				<p>When you're in an abusive relationship, a protection plan will include ways your kids can stay safe when there's abuse in your house. It's important to note that if the abuse escalates you can avoid running to the kids because your attacker could also harm them.</p>
				<p><strong>Planning For Violence In The Home</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Teach kids how and when to dial 10920.</li>
					<li>When necessary, warn them to leave home when things begin to escalate, and where they can go.</li>
					<li>Come on with a code word you can use when they need to leave home in an emergency — make sure they don't know what the hidden word means to anyone.</li>
					<li>In the house: find a place they can go to when they are frightened and when they are frightened they can think about it.</li>
					<li>Tell them to stay away from the kitchen, bathroom and other places where objects may be used as weapons.</li>
					<li>Teach them that they should never interfere, even if they wish to protect their parent.</li>
					<li>Help them build a list of people they 're confident to talk to and express themselves to.</li>
					<li>Inscribe them into a counselling programme. Many local service agencies provide services for children.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Planning for unmonitored Visits</strong></p>
				<p>When you have separated yourself from an abusive partner and are worried about the safety of your children while they visit your partner, it may be helpful to create a protection plan for them when they visit.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Brainstorm with your kids (if they're old enough) to come up with ways to keep them safe using the same model you 'd have for your own home. Let them know where to get to a mobile, how to leave the house and how to go.</li>
					<li>If it's possible to do, give the children a mobile phone to use in emergency situations — this can be used to dial 10920, a friend or you if they need assistance.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Safe Custody Exchanges Planning</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Stop sharing custody at home, or at home, with your parent.</li>
					<li>Meet in a discreet, public place such as a restaurant, a bank / other area with lots of cameras or even a police station nearby.</li>
					<li>Bring a partner or relative to the exchange with you, or let them do the exchange.</li>
					<li>Perhaps intend to get your partner to pick up the kids from school at the end of the day after you drop them off in the morning-this reduces the opportunity to see each other.</li>
					<li>Emotional security plan as well – figure out something to do before the exchange to calm down any nerves you feel, and something after focusing on yourself or the kids, like going to a park or doing a fun activity.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>How to Hold These Talks</strong></p>
				<p>Let your child know that what is going on is not their fault, and that they have not caused it. Let them know how much you love them, and give them whenever you want. Tell them that you want to protect them and that you want everyone to be safe, so you need to come up with an emergency plan to use.It's important to remember that when you're with a child in safety planning, they might tell the abusive partner this information, which could make the situation more dangerous (e.g. "Mom said to do this if you get angry.") When talking to your child about these plans, use phrases like "We 're practicing what to do in an emergency" instead of "We 're planning what you can do when dad / mom gets angry."</p>

			<div class="collapse" id="safety3">
				<p>Studies indicate that up to 65 percent of victims of domestic abuse are unable to flee their abusive spouses because they are worried about what will happen when they leave to their pets. Fortunately, there are increasing numbers of resources in place to help with this difficult situation.</p>
				<p>When you are developing your own protection plan to escape an abusive relationship, it's also vital for your pets to prepare for protection. Provide them with extra provisions, copies of their medical records and important phone numbers.</p>
				<p>Do not leave pets alone with an abusive partner where possible. When you intend to leave, negotiate emergency treatment for your pet with relatives, family or your veterinarian. If this is not an option, search for services which assist survivors of domestic violence with safekeeping for their pets by state or zip code. Search zip code first, then attempt a search by state when there are no results. If none of the results are possible for your case, immediately contact your nearest domestic abuse or animal shelter. Visit the Humane Society website for support in locating an animal shelter.</p>
				<p>If you have had to leave your pet behind with your abusive partner, try asking for help from law enforcement or animal control officials to see if they can intervene.</p>
				<p>Take steps to prove your pet's ownership: get them vaccinated and license them to your town, making sure these registrations are made in your name (change them if they are not).Note that certain states require pets to be a part of these if you are talking about having a protection order.</p>
				<p>When you have abandoned your family, make sure your pet is safe by changing veterinarians and not leaving the pets alone outside.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The Center for Animal Protection provides additional health training tips for pets.</li>
					<li>Organizations such as Ahimsa House in Georgia and Littlegrass Ranch in Texas provide advice on animal safety preparation, particularly for non-traditional animals such as horses which are more difficult to transport.</li>
					<li>Red Rover offers different grant programs to enable victims to leave their abusive partners without having to leave their pets behind. The grants must be submitted by a shelter worker.</li>

			<div class="collapse" id="safety4">
				<p>Pregnancy is a changetime. Pregnancy can be full of anticipation but it also comes with an added need for assistance. It's natural to need a partner's emotional support, as well as maybe financial assistance, aid in planning for the baby and more.</p>
				<p>If your partner is mentally or physically abusive towards you, this may make these transitional months especially difficult. Fortunately, services are available to help encourage women to get the required support for a stable , healthy pregnancy.</p>
				<p>Intimate partner abuse affects about 1.5 million people every year and affects as many as 324,000 pregnant women a year, according to the Centres For Disease Control And Prevention. Pregnancy can be a especially dangerous time for women in abusive relationships, and violence during pregnancy can sometimes start or intensify.</p>
				<p><strong>Ways To Get Help?</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you're pregnant during violent times, there's always an increased chance. If you are in a stairwell home , consider staying in the first floor. One technique that can be effective in keeping healthy is going into the fetal position around your stomach if you're being targeted.</li>
					<li>Visits to doctor can be an opportunity to explore what's going on in your relationship.</li>
					<li>When your partner goes with you to those appointments, consider taking a moment when they're out of the room to ask your care provider (or even the receptionist at the front desk) to come up with an excuse to talk to them one-on-one.</li>
					<li>A health care professional may become an active participant in your decision to quit if you have chosen to end your partnership.</li>
					<li>Ask if you can get a women-only prenatal class, if possible. This could be a supportive place to address parenting issues, or it could encourage you to talk one-on-one with the class teacher.</li>

			<div class="collapse" id="safety5">
				<p>Sometimes the focus is on physical safety training, but it's always important to remember your emotional protection. Emotional protection may look different for different individuals, but essentially it's about having a customized plan that makes you feel like you are embracing your feelings and choices while coping with violence. Below are some ideas for developing and maintaining an emotional safety plan which works for you.</p>
				<p><strong>Seek for people to help:</strong>A supportive presence like a trustworthy friend or family member will help create a calm environment in which to work about tough circumstances and encourage you to consider potential options.</p>
				<p><strong>Identify and Work towards attainable objectives:</strong>One realistic aim might be to contact a local resource to see what resources are available in your area, or to talk to one of our advocates at The Hotline. Remember that you don't have to do something that you're not happy with right now, but when you're ready, taking small steps will help make choices feel more realistic.</p>
				<p><strong>For You to build a peaceful space:</strong>When working through difficult emotions that can arise when dealing with abuse, designating a physical place where your mind can relax and feel safe may be a good option. This can be a room in your home, a place under your favorite tree, a comfy window chair or a low-light room.</p>
				<p><strong>Mind The Good Quality :</strong>You are valuable and unique, and it is so helpful for your emotional wellbeing to realize and remind yourself of that fact. When someone decides to be abusive to you, it is never your fault, and there is no reflection on the great value you have as a human.</p>
				<p><strong>Know You deserve to be kind to You:</strong>Finding time every day to practice self-care, even if it's only for a few minutes, really creates space for harmony and emotional wellbeing. Giving yourself emotional breaks is safe, and often step back from your situation. Essentially this will help you make the right choices for you.</p>

			<h3>Legal Information</h3>
			<div>
				<a type="button" class="btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#legal1">Protective orders</a>
				<div class="collapse" id="legal1">
					<p><strong>There are some legal actions you can take to help keep yourself safe from your abusive partner. The Hotline does not give legal advice, nor are we legal advocates, but there are some great resources available to you in your community.</strong></p>
					<p>Please call 10920 or chat with us and our advocates can connect you with resources for legal help.</p>
					<p><strong>Protective Orders</strong></p>
					<p>A restraining order will help protect you instantly by legally prohibiting your abuser from getting near you physically, hurting you or threatening you, your kids or family members. Such legal paperwork will also include clauses relating to custody, insurance and more to keep your abusive partner away from you.</p>
					<p>Although protective orders that put a stop to physical violence, there is still space for psychological abuse — so a protective order can never replace a protection plan. When you do have a protection order, it should always be held on you — and copies should be given to your kids and anyone they might be with — particularly when you leave your partner.</p>
					<p>You will get a Protective Order filing at:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Courthouses</li>
						<li>Women’s shelters</li>
						<li>Volunteer legal services offices and some police stations.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Other Legal Actions</strong></p>
					<p>You do have the right to lodge an complaint against your partner for issues like sexual abuse, aggravated assault, harassment , bullying or child custody intervention. Ask your local court for a community legal services agency (attorneys who offer free legal care to low-income individuals) or advocacy group in your region about the policies.</p>
